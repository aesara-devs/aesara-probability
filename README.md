# Probability measures in Aesara

This project contains documents in `org-mode` (`.org` files) that attempt to
formalize the way random variables and probability measures are represented and
manipulated across the Aesara projects: 

- [Aesara](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara)
- [AePPL](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aeppl)
- [AeMCMC](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc)

# Building

You will need Emacs (â‰¥ 26), and, to build the PDFs, you'll need a full LaTeX
distribution (e.g. TeXlive, Mactex). With those two basic requirements, you can
use the make targets to automatically download the Emacs requirements and build
the PDFs and/or the intermediate LaTeX files.
