# Introduction

This project provides a template layout for TeX-based projects.
It contains subdirectories for different scripting languages and
some example documents that use their respective `noweb` libraries.
There are also some `Makefiles` that build/manage these documents
in a unix-based system (Ubuntu, really).

# Dependencies

Each `noweb` file has it's own languages' dependencies, so
look through those files to find out exactly what those are.
Otherwise, this setup broadly assumes the following are
installed:

* [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
